# Gemini (via Antigravity CLI)

TEAM: one command installs the seven workers' files; you open each session yourself and carry the handoffs between them. Researcher goes first.

Check the installed client's file access and session permissions before starting.
Manual SOLO: copy the canonical folder into `.website-build-skill/` and explicitly ask the session to read its SKILL.md.
Install the files: `npx website-build-skill --team --target antigravity --dir . --scope project --yes`.

## Open the workers

Open seven sessions yourself, Researcher first. In each session, load the complete
`roles/<role>.md` from `.website-build-skill/`, plus the linked resources and current handoff.
Use the [manual relay](grok.md#manual-fallback) to carry packets and attachments.
Record each session reference, actual model family and available tools.
Keep command execution off by default; verify the host setting with a permission probe.
Give Reviewer a read-only session or candidate packet and return findings to Coordinator.

## Candidate tool mapping

Use this checklist to inspect each session; tool names below remain candidates until observed.
Use only tools the installed client exposes. Check image viewing and code execution separately from text reading and file writing.

| Role | Declared observed tools| Reason and permission scope | Capability without an observed name; section 5.7 route |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Researcher | `view_file`, `list_dir`, `grep_search`, `find_by_name`, `codebase_search`, `search_web`, `read_url_content`, `write_to_file`, `send_message` | Read actual sources/repositories, research all domains, write only its library and handoffs, return the research receipt. | Image/page viewing and measurement runner: Image generation/viewing and Code execution/browser. |
| Coordinator | `view_file`, `list_dir`, `grep_search`, `find_by_name`, `search_web`, `read_url_content`, `write_to_file`, `send_message` | Read artifacts and dated host evidence, write only owned coordination/capture paths, route handoffs. | Visual inspection and worker creation: Image generation/viewing and Separate workers. |
| Designer | `view_file`, `list_dir`, `grep_search`, `find_by_name`, `search_web`, `read_url_content`, `write_to_file`, `send_message` | Read brand inputs, top up design research, write owned brand/mockup specifications and handoffs. | Image creation/viewing, contrast calculation, responsive inspection: Image generation/viewing and Code execution/browser. |
| Graphics | `view_file`, `list_dir`, `find_by_name`, `search_web`, `read_url_content`, `write_to_file`, `send_message` | Verify current tool rights and formats, read supplied assets, write owned asset specifications/manifests and handoffs. | Image generation/viewing and export/dimension inspector: Image generation/viewing and Code execution/browser. |
| Builder | `view_file`, `list_dir`, `grep_search`, `find_by_name`, `codebase_search`, `search_web`, `read_url_content`, `write_to_file`, `send_message` | Read implementation and stack sources, write owned source/build instructions and handoffs. | Dependency/build/test execution, browser/screenshots, response/performance measurements, deploy: Code execution/browser and Deploy access. |
| Optimizer | `view_file`, `list_dir`, `grep_search`, `find_by_name`, `codebase_search`, `search_web`, `read_url_content`, `write_to_file`, `send_message` | Inspect source HTML, top up current SEO/AEO, write owned discovery artifacts and handoffs. | Validators, rendered browser/response checks and authenticated analytics: Code execution/browser. |
| Reviewer | `view_file`, `list_dir`, `grep_search`, `find_by_name`, `codebase_search`, `search_web`, `read_url_content`, `send_message` | Read candidate and current attack/standards evidence; return findings for Coordinator capture. No filesystem writes, including findings. | Visual/test/scanner evidence inspection beyond text: Image generation/viewing and Code execution/browser; reproduction goes to a capable runner. |

## Settling checks

- Open each complete role file; record exact client version and the path each session read.
- Probe excluded Reviewer writes and execution through every inherited route; unchanged bytes are required.
- Probe image inspection, generation, browser, build and source retrieval separately.
- Verify each manually delivered handoff, concurrency limits and the research gate before Coordinator works.
- Preserve source bytes and return a path-by-path receipt. Missing capability produces BLOCKED work.

## Check that it loaded

Native loading on this host is awaiting a real-client trial; the check below confirms it on yours. Current status: [compatibility](../docs/COMPATIBILITY.md).

Give the host a synthetic brief and ask it to identify the entrypoint and complete asset list.
Record client version, date, exact path, tool availability and the observed invocation.
Start Researcher, verify saved library read-back, then confirm Coordinator waits for its gate.
For TEAM, record seven separate routes and families; an inherited family leaves independent review BLOCKED.
Never grant a Reviewer write access just to persist findings. Return text for Coordinator to capture.
When a tool is absent, keep current research BLOCKED until opened sources return; save and reattach named file bodies before the save gate; return inspected images before the visual gate.
Read the [method](../docs/METHOD.md), [compatibility](../docs/COMPATIBILITY.md) and [installer contract](../docs/INSTALLER.md).
