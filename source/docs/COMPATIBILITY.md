# Compatibility

## Tested hosts

Three hosts have a dated native-loading receipt. Each covers SOLO skill discovery and loading
on the exact version below, from one run under the operator's existing client configuration
(each receipt lists its limitations); the full SOLO build route, TEAM and deployment stay
documented until a trial records them.

| Host | Version and system | Mode and scope | Date | Receipt |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | 2.1.281, macOS 26.6.2 arm64 | SOLO, native loading tested | 2026-09-24 | [receipt](evidence/host-trial-claude-code-2026-09-24.json) |
| Codex CLI | 0.154.0, macOS 26.6.2 arm64 | SOLO, native loading tested | 2026-09-24 | [receipt](evidence/host-trial-codex-2026-09-24.json) |
| Grok Build CLI | 1.0.40, macOS 26.6.2 arm64 | SOLO, native loading tested in a trusted folder | 2026-09-24 | [receipt](evidence/host-trial-grok-build-2026-09-24.json) |

Every other host has a documented setup and
a check you run, in its own adapter guide, to confirm it loaded on yours. A host moves from
documented to tested when its receipt records the client/runtime version, trial date,
operating system, package revision, installed paths and hashes, invocation, observed
output, failure cases and remaining checks, kept sanitized in this repository.
Hosted repository checks have a [revision-bound baseline receipt](evidence/audit-baseline.json).

## Hosts with a documented setup

These guides describe file-copy, upload and manual-session routes. Their official documentation
links are verification targets for a client trial. A documented setup becomes a tested-host entry
when its receipt demonstrates loading, file access, tool permissions and the selected workflow.

## Evidence to collect

- **Documentation:** save the opened official source, version, access date and setup facts it supports.
- **Native loading:** record the actual entrypoint and every resource the client can read.
- **TEAM:** one command installs the seven workers' files; you open each session yourself and carry the handoffs between them. Researcher goes first. Record separate session references, setup acknowledgements, model families and permission probes.
- **Delivery:** record fresh package installs for each operating system being claimed, including Linux and Windows.
- **Uploads and URLs:** verify account ZIP controls and raw-URL retrieval in the actual client.
- **Runtime:** the package declares Node 18 or newer; [the check workflow](https://github.com/aunysillyme/website-build-skill/blob/main/.github/workflows/check.yml) defines its runtime matrix.

## Working with the tools you have

The [canonical tool table](../skills/website-build-skill/playbooks/research-and-memory.md#working-with-the-tools-you-have)
supplies the next step for research, saved files, visual mockups, measurements, independent review and release.
Each stage resumes when its required tool output or evidence is available.
